## Overview

Roze, a biological researcher, and her lab have partnered up with a food startup company called Improbable Beef. They are hoping to identify a species of bacteria that can synthesize proteins to imitate the taste of meat. Roza believes this bacteria could be present within the human belly button.

## Summary

Many anonymous participants have had their navels sampled and the results are readily available to them through this site. They can see their top 10 bacterial strains as a bar chart, how often they scrub their belly buttons as a gauge chart, and an overview off all of the strains found in the form of a bubble chart. All they have to do is select their participant ID # to view their information. If Improbable Beef and Roza's lab are able to identify the bacterial species they are hoping for, some participants with the highest amounts of that strain, or strains, can know that their navels are meant for so much more in life than they ever expected.
